# Solana Wallet Generator Script

## Overview

This Python script generates Solana wallets and extracts their public keys. It creates two CSV files:
1. A file containing full wallet information (public key, private key, and Solana Scan link)
2. A file containing only the public keys of the generated wallets

**Important Security Note:** All wallets and keys are generated locally on your device. No information is shared with the script author or any third parties. You have full control and responsibility for the security of the generated wallets.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `csv`: For reading and writing CSV files
- `base58`: For encoding private keys
- `solders`: For generating Solana keypairs

## Main Functions

### 1. `generate_wallets_to_csv(num_wallets, file_path)`

This function generates a specified number of Solana wallets and writes their information to a CSV file.

- **Parameters:**
  - `num_wallets`: The number of wallets to generate
  - `file_path`: The path to the CSV file where wallet information will be stored

- **Output CSV Format:**
  - Wallet No.
  - Public Key
  - Private Key
  - Solana Scan Link

### 2. `extract_public_keys(original_csv_path, new_csv_path)`

This function reads the full wallet information CSV and creates a new CSV containing only the public keys.

- **Parameters:**
  - `original_csv_path`: Path to the full wallet information CSV
  - `new_csv_path`: Path where the new CSV with only public keys will be saved

- **Output CSV Format:**
  - Wallet No.
  - Public Key

## Usage

1. Set the `wallets` variable to the number of wallets you want to generate.
2. Run the script.
3. Two CSV files will be generated:
   - `solana_wallets.csv`: Contains full wallet information
   - `public_keys.csv`: Contains only the public keys

## Note

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed and that you're using the correct version of the `solders` package that includes the `Keypair` class.

## Security Warnings

1. Local Generation: This script generates all wallets and keys locally on your device. No data is transmitted over the internet or shared with any external parties.

2. Private Key Protection: Keep the generated private keys secure. The CSV file containing private keys should be treated with utmost confidentiality. Anyone with access to a private key has full control over the associated wallet.

3. Responsibility: You are solely responsible for the security and management of the generated wallets and keys. Make sure to store them securely and create backups as needed.

Remember, the security of your wallets depends on how you handle and store the information generated by this script.
